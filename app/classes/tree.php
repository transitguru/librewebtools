   * Provides IDs for items that are traversable in the tree

   * See the theoretical tree below to get an understanding on how it works:
   *
   *                              0
   *                             / \
   *                            1   2
   *                           / \   \
   *                          3   4   8
   *                         / \   \
   *                        5   6   7
   *
   * Say the input $id is 3 and an empty array. As designed, the 
   * method would return [3,5,6,1,0] because it first gets all descendents of
   * the subject tree id number, then gets direct ancestors. No siblings or
   * ancestor's siblings (a.k.a. "aunts/uncles") would be returned.
   *
   * The current assumptions are the following:
   *  - the 'id' is the ID, and the 'parent_id' is Parent ID in the database
   *  - Both fields are in the same table, and both fields are any INT() type
   *  - the root ID of the tree is 0 
   *  - the parent ID of the root item is NULL
   *  - the key for parent ID is named 'parent_id'
   * 
   * @param array $ids Array of ids already found from previous iterations
   *
   * @return array All IDs that are above or below the item in question
